  ## Building and installation instructions

  The easiest way to install InfSeqExt is via
  [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):
  ```shell
  opam repo add coq-extra-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev
  opam install coq-inf-seq-ext
  ```

  To instead build and install manually, do:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/DistributedComponents/InfSeqExt.git
  cd InfSeqExt
  make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine>
  make install
  ```

  ## Documentation

  InfSeqExt is based on an [earlier library][infseq-paper] by Deng and Monin.
  It is intended as a more comprehensive alternative to [Streams][streams-link]
  in the Coq standard library. In particular, InfSeqExt provides machinery commonly
  used when reasoning about temporal properties of system execution traces, and
  follows the modal operator [name conventions][spin-ltl-link] used in the Spin model checker.

  ### Files

  - `infseq.v`: main definitions and results
    - coinductive definition of infinite sequences
    - definitions and notations for modal operators and connectors
        - basic modal operators: `now`, `next`, `consecutive`, `always1`, `always`, `weak_until`, `until`, `release`, `eventually`
        - composite modal operators: `inf_often`, `continuously`
        - modal connectors: `impl_tl` (`->_`), `and_tl` (`/\_`), `or_tl` (`\/_`), `not_tl` (`~_`)
    - lemmas about modal operators and connectors
    - tactics
  - `map.v`: corecursive definitions of the `map` and `zip` functions for use on infinite sequences, and related lemmas
  - `exteq.v`: coinductive definition of extensional equality (`exteq`) for infinite sequences, and related lemmas
  - `subseq.v`: coinductive definitions of infinite subsequences and related lemmas
  - `classical.v`: lemmas about modal operators and connectors when assuming classical logic (excluded middle)

  ### Related libraries

  InfSeqExt has some overlap with the less exhaustive [CTLTCTL][ctltctl-link]
  and [LTL][ltl-link] Coq contributions, which provide similar machinery.
  In contrast to CTLTCTL and LTL, InfSeqExt does not provide a definition
  of traces following some labeled reduction relation, nor an explicit
  notion of time. Fairness is also left up to library users to define.

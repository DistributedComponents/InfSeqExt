Coq library for reasoning inductively and coinductively on infinite sequences,
using modal operators similar to those in linear temporal logic (LTL).

## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install InfSeqExt is via
[OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):
```shell
opam repo add coq-extra-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev
opam install coq-inf-seq-ext
```

To instead build and install manually, do:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/DistributedComponents/InfSeqExt.git
cd InfSeqExt
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine>
make install
```

## Documentation

InfSeqExt is based on an [earlier library][infseq-paper] by Deng and Monin.
It is intended as a more comprehensive alternative to [Streams][streams-link]
in the Coq standard library. In particular, InfSeqExt provides machinery commonly
used when reasoning about temporal properties of system execution traces, and
follows the modal operator [name conventions][spin-ltl-link] used in the Spin model checker.

### Related libraries

InfSeqExt has some overlap with the less exhaustive [CTLTCTL][ctltctl-link]
and [LTL][ltl-link] Coq contributions, which provide similar machinery.
In contrast to CTLTCTL and LTL, InfSeqExt does not provide a definition
of traces following some labeled reduction relation, nor an explicit
notion of time. Fairness is also left up to library users to define.
